A cat can either be a house cat, \n          a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. \n          Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. \n          About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class='copy'>Copy</div>\n    </div>",document.querySelector(".button").addEventListener("click",(()=>{document.querySelector(".content").classList.toggle("collapse")}))})();
